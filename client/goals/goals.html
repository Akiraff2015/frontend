        <h1>What are your main goals, if you get accepted to General Assembly?</h1>
        <p>Even if the topic seems fairly beginner for me, however I am always willing to learn more. Especially offerring a full-stack web development
            course, which will be exposed into several environments. Something I find it challenging yet fun. As I tend to self adapt myself when new frameworks
            and libraries are introduced towards me. By the end course, I would like to have enough knowledge in finding the best solutions for my future projects.</p>

        <p>I would like to expand my social circle. Especially Hong Kong is a big place, I seem to be missing a lot in my life; simply because my current job, doesn't
            seem to suit me. I would like to make new friends and meet professional senior developers who can mentor me.</p>

        <h1>What are your future goals?</h1>
        <p>I want to build applications that can help in Food & Beverage industries. Not only I have passion in programming, but also have passion for food.
            I want to develop applications, that can increase performance and profit towards the Food & Beverage companies.</p>

        <p>Hoping to join a hackathon! Always wanted to join a hackthon, once I gathered enough experience in development stage. And hopefully can create applications
            that will help towards society!</p>

        <p>Opening a startup business, once I get enough knowledge in a professional level at full-stack web development.</p>
