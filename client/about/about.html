            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Akira, I am an enthusiastic programmer. I started learning programming back in high school back in Grade 10 (2012).
            Once I picked the foundation in programming, I fell in love with it.</p>

            <p>I mainly do programming as hobby and always experimenting new languages, frameworks and IDE. It's been four years yet, I try
            to find something more then just programming.</p>

            <p>I mainly program at my free time as a hobby, always self-learning and encouraging myself that I can always achieve something more
            with my programming skills. Unfortunately I reached a barrier, which I cannot proceed myself in learning more advanced contents such as:
            reflections, polymorphism, lambdas, pointers, database, etc...</p>

            <h1>What do you enjoy the most about Programming</h1>
            <p>The capability in fixing a bug on your program. I feel so fulfilling and self-rewarding when I find a solution towards a bug. I feel like
            I accomplished a lot when fixing a small bug, which I can call off for the day!</p>

            <p>I enjoy a lot front-end web development. However, I want to add more functionality towards my website, and learn back-end web development
            such as: logic and databases, to have a true experience when browsing my website. I don't simply want a static page sitting on my localhost.</p>
